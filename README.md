# PiPact
This is for the independent project PiPact. All files are designed around the Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi OS (formally known as Raspbian)


Most of the code for this will only work on a linux based system (depends on that file structure). All of this code will work on
the raspberry pi without editing many files (if there are any permission errors)
